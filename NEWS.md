## 1.1.1

### Changes

* Added message recommending to update to a newer version of Word when an unsupported platform is detected.

## 1.1.0

### New features

* The uploaded file now stays active after closing the add-in, so it's not needed to re-upload the same statistics file after closing the add-in
* The uploaded file can be removed by clicking on 'Remove file' in the dropdown menu next to the upload button.
* Reported statistics can be replaced with a fixed value, and highlighted.
* Help messages have been added to explain the functionality of the add-in.
* Expanding statistics is now a bit smarter. Some statistics are automatically expanded or hidden depending on the number of groups of statistics.
* Certain groups of statistics (e.g., regression coefficients, ANOVA terms) can be inserted as tables.

### Changes

* Complete overhaul of the UI to create a more modern look and to improve the user-friendliness of the add-in.
* Removed citation buttons and replaced them with a link to the website about how to cite tidystats.
* Statistics are no longer indented to preserve screen space.

## 1.0.0

First release.
